## 📊 **Project Overview**

This assignment explores:

### **1. Market Sentiment (Fear, Greed, Neutral, Extreme values)**
- Loaded from Fear & Greed Index dataset  
- Merged with trader activity by date

### **2. Trader Behavior**
- Volume (USD)  
- Token size  
- Closed PnL  
- Fees  
- Trading frequency  
- Active days  

### **3. EDA Visualizations**
- Daily PnL over time  
- PnL distribution by sentiment  
- Trading volume vs sentiment  
- Outlier detection  

### **4. Predictive Modeling**
- Predict next-day sentiment using RandomForest  
- Lag features and volatility  
- Model evaluation with:
  - Confusion Matrix  
  - ROC Curve  
  - Feature importance  

### **5. Trader Segmentation (Clustering)**
- KMeans clustering of accounts  
- PCA visualization  
- Interpretation of cluster behavior

## 📈 **Key Insights**

- Trader volume increases significantly during **Neutral** and **Greed** phases.
- Highest PnL spikes occur during **Fear**, contradicting typical expectations.
- RandomForest model struggled due to **dataset imbalance** and **limited predictive signal**.
- Clustering revealed distinct trader profiles, even with small samples.

## 📝 **How To Run**

1. Open both notebooks in Google Colab.  
2. Upload the CSV files inside `/csv_files`.  
3. Run **notebook_1.ipynb** first to generate processed data.  
4. Run **notebook_2.ipynb** for modeling and clustering.  
5. Outputs will be saved automatically into the `/outputs` folder.
